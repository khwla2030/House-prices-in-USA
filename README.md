## Problem Statement <a name="Problem-Statement"></a>

This project is about house pricing competition on Kaggle,  which intends to apply EDA and  machine learning models in order to predict the house pricing for USA Housing dataset by using python .

Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

## Conclusion <a name="Conclusion"></a>

In conclusion, we used multiple data cleaning and EDA techniques to analyze and visualize our dataset.In the end, we applied multiple machine learning methods in order to predict the Sale Price of the houses in the test data set. The regrission models used were Linear, Ridge, Lasso, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest and a few more models. We achieved a good score in Kaggle competition.
